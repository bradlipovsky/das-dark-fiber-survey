We have a short fiber   2.5 kms in the middle of the city, used to monitor urban traffic through the  communication fiber trunking used for communication purposes.

We think that the fact of not having the fiber buried in the ground is the explanation to our failure in the experiment. Thank you for everything in any case. "
